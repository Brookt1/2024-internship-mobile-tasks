# E-Commerce Flutter UI Implementation

This project implements a Flutter user interface based on a reference design provided in a Figma file. The goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible, focusing on colors, layout, typography, and design elements. The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and is built with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using **Bloc** for state management.

## Requirements

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure that you have Flutter SDK installed. Follow the [installation guide here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dependencies**: The project uses standard Flutter dependencies. Run `flutter pub get` to install them.

## Implementation Details

### Design Replication

The user interface closely matches the design provided in the Figma. The focus areas include:

- **Colors**: Matching the color scheme as closely as possible.
- **Layout**: Ensuring the layout and positioning of elements are consistent with the design.
- **Typography**: Using the specified fonts, sizes, and weights.
- **Design Elements**: Including specific design elements such as buttons, icons, and images.

### Widgets and Components

Flutter widgets and components are utilized to build the UI:

- `Container`: For layout and styling.
- `Column` & `Row`: For arranging widgets vertically and horizontally.
- `Image`: To display images.
- `Text`: For displaying text.
- `Button`: For interactive elements.
